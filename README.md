# pi-info
pi-info is a short script to provide information on a Raspberry Pi Board that it is being run on.

After I got several different Raspberry Pi's, 
I wanted to have a simple script that I could run to tell me at a glance the characteristics of the
board that I'm logged into.

Some of the information used by the script came from a blog post by 
Matt at Raspberry Spy's blog post at,

Your blog post is gratefully acknowledged.
