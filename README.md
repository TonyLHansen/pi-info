# pi-info
pi-info is a short script to provide information on a Raspberry Pi Board that it is written on.

After I got several different Raspberry Pi's, 
I wanted to have a simple script that I could run to tell me at a glance the characteristics of the
board that I'm logged into.

Some of the information used by the script came from a blog post by 
Matt at Raspberry Spy's blog post at,
http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/09/checking-your-raspberry-pi-board-version/
Your blog post is gratefully acknowledged.
